# symbols_check

## On Linux
```
make
./athenb
./athenb_hidden
./athenb_hidden_last
```
Confirm that both "Hello from scipy_a" and "Hello from scipy_b" is printed when athenb_hidden/athenb_hidden_last is run (and just "Hello from scipy_a" printed twice when athenb is run).

## OSX

Untested!

```
make -f Makefile.osx
./athenb
./athenb_hidden
./athenb_hidden_last
```
Interested in the result!
