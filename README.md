# symbols_check

## On Linux
```
make
./athenb
./athenb_hidden
```
Confirm that both "Hello from scipy_a" and "Hello from scipy_b" is printed when athenb_hidden is run (and just "Hello from scipy_a" printed twice when athenb is run.

## OSX
```
make -f Makefile.osx
./athenb
```
Interested in the result!
